Purpose: To build an API using Django and Python, integrating PostgreSQL, and adhering to the principles of CRUD, Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, test-driven development (TDD), and Docker for containerization,


Week 1: Foundation and Setup

Day 1-2: Python and Django Basics
Focus: Refresh Python skills if necessary and learn Django basics.

Day 4-5: Django Models and Admin
Focus: Define your data models and integrate with Django Admin.
Tasks:
Create models based on your application's requirements (e.g., User, SpriteSheet, Character).
Register models in Django admin to manipulate data easily.
Resources:
Django Models documentation.
Understanding Django Admin.

Week 2: API Development and Dockerization

Day 6-7: Django REST Framework and API
Focus: Build API endpoints using Django REST Framework.
Tasks:
Install Django REST Framework.
Create serializers for your models.
Develop views and routers for handling CRUD operations on spritesheets and characters.
Resources:

Define services in a docker-compose.yml including Django app and PostgreSQL.
Resources:
Official Docker documentation.
Docker Compose documentation.

Day 10-11: Frontend Interaction and Final Testing
Focus: Ensure your API can be consumed by a front-end or external services.
Tasks:
Build or simulate a simple front-end that interacts with your API (optional).
Perform end-to-end testing with all components integrated.
Resources:
Basic guides on React or another frontend framework if needed.

Day 12-14: Documentation and Cleanup
Focus: Document your API and perform final cleanups.
Tasks:
Write API documentation (consider tools like Swagger).
Refactor and optimize code and Docker setups.
Resources:
Swagger for API documentation.
